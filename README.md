game.py

    Responsibility: This is the main game file, responsible for initializing the game, handling events, and rendering the game state.
    Design Patterns:
        Singleton: GameStateManager is used as a singleton, ensuring that only one instance manages the game state.
        Factory Method: DrawFactory class follows the Factory Method pattern to create different drawing objects, encapsulating the drawing logic.
        Main Game Loop: Contains the game loop for event handling, updating game state, and rendering.

draw_factory.py

    Responsibility: Manages the rendering of different game elements like buttons, grid, and cells.
    Design Patterns:
        Factory Method: Encapsulates the creation of different visual components (buttons, cells, grid) in the DrawFactory class. This abstraction separates the rendering details from the main game logic.

game_state_manager.py

    Responsibility: Manages the game state, including saving, loading, and updating the state of cells.
    Design Patterns:
        Singleton: Implements the Singleton pattern to ensure a single, global point of access to the game state.
        State Management: Encapsulates the state of the game and provides methods to modify it, adhering to the principles of Encapsulation in Object-Oriented Programming.

General Observations

    Your code structure effectively separates concerns: game.py for game mechanics and event handling, draw_factory.py for rendering, and game_state_manager.py for state management.
    The use of classes and separation of concerns makes your code more maintainable and scalable. For example, if you want to change how drawing is handled, you only need to modify DrawFactory.
    Consider adding more comments for clarity, especially in complex sections of the code, to improve readability and maintainability.
